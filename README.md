# ddpTiles
A tool that leverages arcpy and data driven pages to create tile packages (tpk) for offline slippy maps. The tool must be run from the mxd
from which the MXDs are generated. A Word document workflow is included with the repository. The zip folder contains an ArcGIS toolbox ready to be used in a desktop environment.

Larger tile packages are easier to generate and ensure coverage but rapidly run up against the storage available on less expensive tablets. This seems like something other people are doing in mbtiles but I didn't see anything on how to generate tile package series, so I thought I would share.
